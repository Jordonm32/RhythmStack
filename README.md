## Introduction
RythmStack is a web application designed to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable experience for listening to their favorite tracks. The application allows users to browse, play, and create playlists from a vast music library, all within a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Goals and Objectives
- **Ease of Use**: Offer an intuitive interface that makes browsing, playing, and managing music simple and enjoyable.
- **Rich Music Library**: Provide access to a comprehensive collection of songs with detailed metadata, including artist, album, and genre information.
- **Personalization**: Allow users to create and manage their playlists, and save their favorite tracks.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle a large and growing number of users and tracks.

## System Architecture
The system architecture consists of the following components:
- **Frontend**: Built using React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Developed using Node.js and Express.js to manage server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, playlists, and track metadata.
- **Authentication**: Implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

## User Stories
1. **As a user, I want to browse available tracks so that I can discover new music.**
2. **As a user, I want to search for specific songs, artists, or albums so that I can quickly find what I want to listen to.**
3. **As a user, I want to create and manage playlists so that I can organize my favorite songs.**
4. **As a user, I want to play, pause, skip, and control the volume of my music so that I can enjoy my listening experience.**
5. **As a user, I want to create an account so that I can save my playlists and track preferences.**
6. **As an admin, I want to manage the music library so that I can ensure it is up-to-date and accurate.**

## Database Design
The database schema includes the following collections:
- **Users**: Stores user information such as username, email, password, and playlists.
- **Tracks**: Stores track information such as title, artist, album, genre, duration, and file location.
- **Playlists**: Stores playlist information such as name, user reference, and track list.

## API Endpoints
The API endpoints include:
- **User Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/login`: Authenticate a user.
  - `GET /api/user`: Retrieve user information.
- **Track Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/tracks`: Retrieve a list of available tracks.
  - `GET /api/tracks/:id`: Retrieve detailed information about a specific track.
  - `POST /api/tracks`: Add a new track (admin only).
  - `PUT /api/tracks/:id`: Update track information (admin only).
  - `DELETE /api/tracks/:id`: Delete a track (admin only).
- **Playlist Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/playlists`: Create a new playlist.
  - `GET /api/playlists`: Retrieve a list of user's playlists.
  - `GET /api/playlists/:id`: Retrieve detailed information about a specific playlist.
  - `PUT /api/playlists/:id`: Update a playlist (e.g., add/remove tracks).
  - `DELETE /api/playlists/:id`: Delete a playlist.

## User Interface Design
The user interface includes the following pages:
- **Home Page**: Displays featured tracks, playlists, and search functionality.
- **Track Listing Page**: Shows a list of available tracks with filters and sorting options.
- **Track Detail Page**: Provides detailed information about a specific track and options to play it or add it to a playlist.
- **Playlist Page**: Allows users to create, view, and manage their playlists.
- **User Profile Page**: Allows users to view and edit their profile information.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Enables admins to manage the music library and user playlists.

## Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
- **Authentication**: Implement JWT for secure user authentication.
- **Authorization**: Ensure that only authorized users can access certain endpoints and perform specific actions.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

## Deployment
- **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- **Hosting**: Deploy the application on a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku.

## Conclusion
RythmStack aims to provide a rich and enjoyable music listening experience with a focus on user-friendly design, personalization, and scalability. By following this design document, we can ensure that the application meets its goals and objectives while delivering a high-quality user experience.
